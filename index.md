## About Me

I develop software mostly in `Python` and am interested in Robotics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Software Engineering in general.
I studied Information Systems at [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/). As part of my Diploma thesis I created [labelCloud](https://github.com/ch-sa/labelCloud), a software to annotate 3D bounding boxes in point clouds, which I published under a free license and maintain since.
