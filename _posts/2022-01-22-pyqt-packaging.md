Recently I was struggling to package my PyQt software
[labelCloud](https://github.com/ch-sa/labelCloud) for `pip`. It turns out that just
because something works for you locally doesn't mean it will still work after you
package it. And some PyQt specifics add some extra stones to the track. So I began my
journey into the joys of Python packaging. This post might not be a best practice but
its intention is to spare you some detours and get to a working setup quickly.


## Adjusting the Package Structure

First things first: the package structure! Not all module architectures are well suited
for packaging. Looking at some of the rather popular Python packages like
[`numpy`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy),
[`pandas`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) or
[`requests`](https://github.com/psf/requests) we see that there is a consensus at least
about the top level structure. All projects have folder with the same name as the future
package and repository. So go ahead and do the same and also add an `__init__.py` and a
`__main__.py` file in that folder. For labelCloud this ended up looking like that:

{% highlight shell %}
labelCloud
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ documentation.md
â”œâ”€â”€ labelCloud
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __main__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...  # add your modules here
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
{% endhighlight %}

This is the new package skeleton. While maybe before the root of the repository was the
entry point to your software this should now live inside the new folder. Everything
within is considered for packaging while everything outside is not directly relevant.

Note that contrary to the example Python modules and also PyPI packages should be named
all lowercase (see [PEP
8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names) and [PEP
423](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0423/#follow-pep-8-for-syntax-of-package-and-module-names)).
{: class="info"}

Once you start releasing your package, this should be [reasonably
versioned](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-scheme), usually in the
`major.minor.patch` scheme. This version is specified in the top level
[`__init__.py`](https://github.com/ch-sa/labelCloud/blob/master/labelCloud/__init__.py)
file:

{% highlight python %}
# labelCloud/__init__.py
__version__ = "0.7.3"
{% endhighlight %}

Now people can retrieve the version of your package by calling `labelCloud.__version__`.

The `__main__.py` file is now used as *entrypoint* to your package. It will be called
whenever somebody runs your package using `python -m labelCloud`. Consequently it should
contain all the logic to correctly startup your software. However it should not be
massive and mostly delegate to logic within your package. It can also handle arguments
that were passed with the call:

{% highlight python %}
# labelCloud/main.py
import argparse
import logging
import sys

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QDesktopWidget

from labelCloud import __version__
from labelCloud.control.controller import Controller
from labelCloud.view.gui import GUI


def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description="Label 3D bounding boxes inside point clouds."
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "-v", "--version", action="version", version="%(prog)s " + __version__
    )
    args = parser.parse_args()

    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    view = GUI(control)
    [...]
    view.show()  # Start GUI
    sys.exit(app.exec_())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the imports inside the `__main__.py` are still absolute. Within the rest of
the package however you should try to reference to your own in relative syntax like
`from .view.gui import GUI`.

## Configuring the Package

Now that the package structure is set up, it's time for configurations. To do this we
will add three new files in the repository root beside the new `labelCloud` folder.

We start with the `pyproject.toml`, which tells pip what tools to use for building your
package. While you can read and [try](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/)
[to](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html)
[understand](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/) the background, you can also
just paste the following and will be fine (as of 2022) for now:

{% highlight python %}
# pyproject.toml
[build-system]
requires = [
    "setuptools>=42",
    "wheel"
]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
{% endhighlight %}

<!-- TODO: Explain Setuptools -->

Now comes the magic of the legendary `setup.py` into play. Looking at the [465 lines
inside numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/setup.py) or the [653 lines
inside pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/setup.py) you might be
tempted to turn around and tell everyone to continue using `git clone`. ðŸ˜€ ... but fear
not, getting a simple package running usually requires a fraction of that effort!

Actually we just need two lines here:

{% highlight python %}
# setup.py
from setuptools import setup

setup()
{% endhighlight %}

That simple?? ... well we still lack the third file. For now we basically just postponed
the pain into another file: the `setup.cfg`.

In the end this file will hold all parameters to package and build your project. It is
structured in multiple *sections*, of which we will be using the following:

1. `[metadata]`
2. `[options]`
   * `[options.entry_points]`
   * `[options.extras_require]`
   * `[options.package_data]`

The **metadata** is the simplest section. Just enter the package `name` as in the
repository and folder, provide `maintainer` and `license` details and add a short
`description`. Then add `keywords` separated by a paragraph and add classifiers
according to [this list](https://pypi.org/classifiers/). Also don't forget to link your
repository or website using the `url` parameter.

Now PyPI also offers the possibility to visualize a longer description on each project
page, as you can see for the [labelCloud page](https://pypi.org/project/labelCloud/). To
get the same, add the path of your README after `file:` to the `long_description`
parameter. PyPI accepts plain text,
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) and [GitHub Flavored
Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), which has to be specified inside
`long_description_content_type`.


Note that PyPI cannot resolve relative links inside the README file. This means you
should make all links (also images etc.) absolute, resulting in paths starting with
something like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ch-sa/labelCl...png`.
{: class="info"}

One of the nicer conveniences of the `setup.cfg` way is that you can automatically
derive the package version from your `labelCloud/__init__.py` file using `version =
attr: labelCloud.__version__`. Thus you have one place less where you could forget about
that. ... you know it was a problem, when there is a [whole site in the Python docs
dedicated to getting a single
string](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/).
ðŸ˜‰

Okay, now that we have the metadata sorted out, let's start with the real stuff:
**options**. There are a number of options we have to set correctly so that the package
is later build correctly and all relevant files are considered. If you have problems
understanding a keyword, take a look at the [official setuptools
reference](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/references/keywords.html).

First of all, we need to specify all packages that should be included. A package is
every folder that contains an `__init__.py` file. You do that by simply adding a point
separated path for every such folder to the `packages` parameter starting with the
folder you created in the [first section](#adjusting-the-package-structure).
Alternatively you can also use `setuptools` automatic package discovery by using:

{% highlight conf %}
# setup.cfg
packages = find:
package_dir =
    =labelCloud
[...]
{% endhighlight %}

Personally I prefer to set them manually to have a bit more control about what's
included.

Do signify with which Python versions your software is compatible you should also set
the `python_requires` parameter. Set it as flexible as possible using [version
specifiers](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-specifiers):

{% highlight conf %}
# setup.cfg
python_requires = >=3.6
[...]
{% endhighlight %}

If your package will depend on other Python packages you also have to specify those
inside `install_requires`. Optionally also restrict the supported versions:

{% highlight conf%}
# setup.cfg
install_requires =
    numpy
    open3d
    PyOpenGL
    PyQt5 <= 5.14.1;platform_system=='Windows'
    PyQt5;platform_system!='Windows'
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see in the last two lines it is also possible to [specify dependencies based
on the user's
platform](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/dependency_management.html#platform-specific-dependencies).
In this case a windows user will pull version 5.14.1 or smaller of PyQt, while all other
platform users can use the most recent version. You can find an overview of all markers
and operators in [PEP 508](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/#id14).


Take care that you don't include dependencies into the `install_requires` that are only
necessary for testing your software. These are usually put into the
`options.extras_require` section and [given the `tests`
identifier](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/dependency_management.html#optional-dependencies):

{% highlight conf%}
# setup.cfg
[options.extras_require]
tests = pytest; pytest-qt
{% endhighlight %}

Users can now also install the test dependencies by providing the identifier to pip in
square brackets:

{% highlight shell %}
pip install labelCloud[tests]  # will also install pytest and pytest-qt
{% endhighlight %}

Note however, that if there are other people participating in the development it makes
sense to "freeze" all dependencies and provide them in a separate `requirements.txt`. 

Remember the `__main__.py` that we [created at the
beginning](#adjusting-the-package-structure)? We already mentioned it will be the
entrypoint into the package. We now have to specify that here as well:

{% highlight conf%}
# setup.cfg
[options.entry_points]
console_scripts =
    labelCloud = labelCloud.__main__:main
{% endhighlight %}

Actually a package have multiple entry points, yet I decided here just for a single one
and therefore named it same as the package: `labelCloud`. It will be available globally
within your Python environment. This means that users can start your software from
everywhere with a simple shell command!

On the other hand this also means you cannot be sure about relative paths for the files
that you use in your software, which brings us to the next section ...


## Managing Package Resources

Now that users can start your software from literally everywhere we cannot rely on a
fixed folder structure like before. We therefore have to find a better way of accessing
files than relative paths.

For the moment `setuptools` will simply ignore your data files. To make them visible we
need to do something weird and pretend that the data folders are also packages by adding
`__init__.py` to each folder. I personally created a single
[`labelCloud/resources`](https://github.com/ch-sa/labelCloud/tree/master/labelCloud/resources)
folder which is collecting all data files.

We tell `setuptools` to retrieve these files by adding the folder locations in the Python
dot-syntax to the `options.package_data` section and specifying which file types should
be considered (alternatively `*` for all):

{% highlight conf%}
# setup.cfg
[options.package_data]
labelCloud.resources = *.ini, *.pcd, *.txt
labelCloud.resources.examples = *.json, *.ply
labelCloud.resources.icons = *.ico, *.png, *.svg, *.txt
labelCloud.resources.interfaces = *.ui
{% endhighlight %}

Now all these files will also be packaged and uploaded to PyPI. The only problem is that
upon install they will be extracted into different places than your current project
structure. This means we need a [way to get the paths of files during
runtime](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html#accessing-data-files-at-runtime).
This is where `pkg_resources` comes into play.

Via the `resource_filename()` function you get the path to a desired file by providing
it's name and import path in dot-syntax. In the following example I retrieve the PyQt UI file, which was previously located at `labelCloud/resources/interfaces/interface.ui`:

{% highlight python%}
import pkg_resources

class GUI(QtWidgets.QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self, control: "Controller") -> None:
        super(GUI, self).__init__()
        uic.loadUi(
            pkg_resources.resource_filename(
                "labelCloud.resources.interfaces", "interface.ui"
            ),
            self,
        )
        [...]
{% endhighlight %}

You can find more `pkg_resources` functions in the [interface
specification](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#resourcemanager-api).


If you changed all your paths in the code like this, the software should be able to
access all data files also after packaging.

## Building the Package

Congratulations, you already passed the most cumbersome section and are slowly entering
the final sprint â€“ [building your
package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives).

First of all you need to have a modern version of PyPA's `build` installed:
{% highlight shell%}
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
{% endhighlight %}

Then change to the root of your repository on the same level as the folder we created in
the first section and run:

{% highlight shell%}
python3 -m build
{% endhighlight %}

This will build your package in an isolated environment. If you are lucky you will see a
green printout at the end similar to:

{% highlight shell %}
...
Successfully built labelCloud-0.7.3.tar.gz and labelCloud-0.7.3-py3-none-any.whl
{% endhighlight %}

Then the build was successful and you now have two files inside the newly created `dist`
directory:

1. `labelCloud-0.7.3-py3-none-any.whl` and
2. `labelCloud-0.7.3.tar.gz`


## Publishing to PyPI

The upload to PyPI is even simpler. However, you should really consider to test your
package on TestPyPI first before you go on and upload to the official PyPI. From my
experience there will be always something wrong with the initial packaging attempt ...
and a lot of times also the second and third. ðŸ˜‰

So go and register for [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/) and
afterwards [PyPI](https://pypi.org/account/register/). In the settings you need to
generate a token and keep it open.

Now you have to install twine and try your first upload:

{% highlight shell%}
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
{% endhighlight %}

Once your test upload and
[installation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#installing-your-newly-uploaded-package)
worked flawlessly you can simply drop the `--repository testpypi` to upload to PyPI.

If everything worked well, you should now be able to see your Python package on it's own
[PyPI project page](https://pypi.org/project/labelCloud/). ðŸŽ‰
